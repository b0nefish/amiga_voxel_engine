# amiga_voxel_engine

Game engine that uses height and color maps for voxel rendering. Works on Amiga A500/1200/3000 and Atari STE/Falcon.

# Amiga setup instructions:

Works on Bebbo's GCC compiler. When you have that, and m68k-amigaos cross-compiler set up, build the demo using make -f makefile_amiga command.

# Atari setup instructions:

M68k-atari-mint cross-compiler required. When you have it set up build the demo using make -f makefile_atari command.
